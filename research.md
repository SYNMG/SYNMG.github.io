My current research interests revolve around corporate finance, corporate governance, and corporate decision-making in emerging markets. Additionally, I maintain a broad interest in topics like green finance and sustainable finance, which hold significant implications for the real world. Employing a diverse array of research methodologies and analytical techniques, I aim to bridge finance theories with practical applications. Actively seeking research opportunities, I remain open to exploring various topics that contribute not only to advancing finance knowledge but also to providing actionable insights to policymakers and practitioners. Please feel free to reach out for collaboration ðŸ˜ƒ
